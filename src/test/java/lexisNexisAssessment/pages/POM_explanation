under this pages package java classes will be added for the pages that is used frequently while testing.
mostly used web elements of the pages will be located and stored in those classes.
Main class will be abstract basePage class and other page classes will extend it. Some methods such as navigating to a module will be created in the abstract basePage class.
P.S. In this framework I will not implement those classes since this is a 3 cases assessment.
