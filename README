Hi.

First of all I appreciate your time for reviewing my test scenarios, scripts and the whole framework.
I tried to put as many comments as possible to make your job easier :).

Should you face any issues while running the test cases please contact me on ahmetbugra_94@hotmail.com or 678 570 0620.
I'll be more than happy to help you out.

The test cases can be found ;
LexisNexisAssesmentBugra\src\test\java\lexisNexisAssessment

Project has been created using Maven, Java, Junit, Cucumber, Gherkin.

POM design pattern has not been implemented because of the size of the assessment.
However, it is explained under pages package.

Regarding message submission test cases; there can be more test cases created in terms of negative testing.
I put one example negative test case.

I had an emergency situation during the assessment weekend but I tried to do my best to demonstrate
my automation skills in Java and Selenium. In a well developed web environment I can definitely perform way too better.

Sincerely,
Bugra Dogan
